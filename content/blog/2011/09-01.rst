Prizes for the raffle

We have a total of **seven prizes**:

1. Two $50 gift cards to `Salt of the Earth <http://www.saltpgh.com/>`__ (our
favourite restaurant in Pittsburgh)
3. One $25 gift card to `La Gourmandine <http://www.lagourmandinebakery.com/>`__
4. Two copies of the English Translation of "A Roda" (Kufunana's showâ€”which we
co-directed). We will sign them too.
6. Two `capulanas <http://beiraproject.org/blog/2010/June/photo-viii>`__
7. A capulana bag

We will use the same system as last year: For every $5 above a $25 donation,
you get a raffle ticket. So, if you donate the recommended $35, you get two
tickets; if you donate $50, you get five!
