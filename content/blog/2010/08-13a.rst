Our show was called **A Rede** (The Network), based on *La Ronde* (which in
Portuguese translates to *A Roda*, get to **A Rede**).

The show was presented in Beira. While we were there, we presented one show
only, but Kufunana is continuing to present the show.

The text and the stories that came out were really very good and we will be
working on writing them down. There were 3 dance scenes, two of which were
symbolic representations of the sexual act as a fight between those infected
with HIV and those not infected (possibly aided by a condom).

The Kufunana actors both created almost all of the dialogue and were great
performers. Without such great people, it would have been ridiculous to stage a
show, in less than two weeks, with no fixed text yet. We had concrete concepts
of what the show should look like (*based on La Ronde, featuring danced
representations of sex and contamination* and some of the ideas for which
characters should appear), but without their improvisational skills at fleshing
out the scenes, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible.
