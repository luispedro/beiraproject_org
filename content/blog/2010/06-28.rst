Last week, we taught theatre classes in Machanga, one of EsMaBaMa’s missions.
This week, we are leaving soon to repeat the same in 2 other missions over the
next two weeks.

Neither of these have internet. In fact, they only have a few hours of
electricity per day, six to nine PM (in Mozambique, everything starts earlier
than in East Coast USA: classes start at seven, so it’s not unreasonable to
have lights-out at nine).

Being a short workshop, the classes, taught to members of pre-existing theatre
groups had two interlocked goals: to teach them some voice, movement, focus
exercises they can use in their own group and work with them with a poem (we
randomly assigned each a poem, all from African poets, all from the Portuguese
curriculum). We combine dramatic expression with text analysis to use this
opportunity to have the students review grammatical and rhetorical concepts
that are focused on in Portuguese language classes.
