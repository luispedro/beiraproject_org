We arrived to the US a week ago, and are back to work at the university, the
fall semester is starting soonâ€¦ But we hope to go back to Mozambique very soon,
this trip was an unforgettable experience!

Our Mozambican projects will continue from Pittsburgh anyway. For now Rita is
going to transcribe and translate the play developed with Kufunana, and Luis is
going to continue to develop the computer tools of the health clinics of
EsMaBaMa.

We will keep you posted.
