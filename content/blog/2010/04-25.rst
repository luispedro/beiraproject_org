Paul van der Boor is one of the founders of `Project Yele
<http://www.yele.nl>`__.  He is also a student here at Carnegie Mellon and
someone who knows him told me I should talk to him.

I didn't have any specific questions for Paul, but he we ended up chatting for
an hour (over Skype as Paul is now in Lisbon not Pittsburgh). He gave me plenty
of good advice based on his experience:

- Do it if you have the time and the contacts.
- Get a local partner.
- Find out what youâ€™re good at and do that.
- Get visibility.
