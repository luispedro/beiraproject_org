1. In the market (see previous video), not all merchants have plastic bags. If
   you are buying from one who does not have them and want one, cry out
   *Plastic* and the *plastic bag seller* will sell you one. Here is a person
   (a little boy, by the way) who makes his living selling individual plastic
   bags.

2. We were looking at a grant application here. As one of the resources of the
   association that was applying, they listed *access to electricity*. It's not
   taken for granted.
