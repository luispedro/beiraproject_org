Our friend Lidio had donated a working laptop. Unfortunately, because Lidio had
spent some time in Japan, upon boot it looked like this:

After installing Ubuntu, it looks much more intelligible (if you understand
Portuguese):

Even fee, the cat, can use it now, to read our blog:

We already gave the laptop to Julio, from `Kufunana
<http://www.kufunana.org>`__ (we are still working on that website too, so it
will grow over the next couple of weeks).
