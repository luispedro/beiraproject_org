We are still working on the final accounting, but it is now clear that we
raised over $2200!

Thank you to : Vasco Calais Pedro, Dr. K, Aken Su, Nichole Faina, and the many
anonymous donours. Also, thank you to Chef Tony Pais at Café Zinho, Tana
restaurant, Whole Foods, Prantl’s Bakery, Big Burrito, `Bueda
<http://www.bueda.com>`__, and `Couchange <http://couchange.org/>`__ for being
our partners.

This would also not have been possible without the efforts of Cordelia, Sabah,
and Grace, who were all wonderful.
