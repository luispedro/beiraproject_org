Changed the domain name.

Unfortunately, tumblr doesn’t let me use more than one domain name, so I am
going to have to redirect projectmaputo.org by myself.

Also, it seems tumblr doesn’t allow multiple authors on your default blog.
That’s a bit annoying. It also doesn’t let change what your default blog is.
That’s more annoying.
