This is Julio from `Kufunana <http://www.kufunana.org>`_. We have a really
interesting video interview with him that we will post once we have translated
it (itâ€™s in Portuguese).

He talks about Kufunana, theatre of the opressed, HIV/AIDS in Mozambique, the
impact of superstitions, and other things.
