After some discussion with our Mozambican friends from Kufunana, the idea of
the wheel (La Ronde, from Schnitzler, which we were thinking of basing our play
on), where character 1 sleeps with 2, 2 with 3, 3 with 4 &c was too limited.
Here we will have **a network**. This seems to be better reflect Mozambican
reality of multiple concurrent sexual partners.

So the working title for our creation is now The Network.
