Last week, as part of the `PAPS <http://www.papsonline.org>`__ Forum, Maria da
Conceição visited Pittsburgh and CMU. We heard her talk during dinner and,
since we were part of the organisation of the Forum, we had a bit more contact
with her and got to know her.

Her work is not only inspiring as a human story, but it also showed how
necessary it is to help some people and that it is possible to do so in small
ways. An economist friend said that he was both touched by the humanity and
professionally impressed by the fact that she had measurable success.

Most amazing is that Maria’s humility is not an act. Once you meet her and hear
her live, you see she’s for real. Her work is at `Dhaka Project
<http://www.thedhakaproject.org/>`__.
