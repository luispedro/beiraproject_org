**May 29 6-pm** we will hold a fundraising cocktail at our house to raise money
to help our partners in Mozambique.

You can come enjoy some wine, cocktails, gourmet food, while helping our
Mozambican partners in their fight against HIV.

**What does this money go to?**

Buying things for our partners on the ground. We will have a detailed list
available online when we make a more formal announcement, but it will consist
mostly of computer hardware, school supplies, &c

This money will not be used to pay for our flights, lodging, or other similar
expenses.

We will more details later, once we have online donations and registration set
up (hopefully, later this week), but for now, save the date: May 29, Saturday
and start telling your friends.
