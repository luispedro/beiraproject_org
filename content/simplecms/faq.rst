Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Why Mozambique? Why Beira?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We were looking for a country where we could help the most and Portuguese
speaking countries get less volunteers than other countries where English is
spoken. Thus, we picked Mozambique.

Beira just happens to be where our partners were located. At one point, we were
in contact with a group in Maputo and this was called Project Maputo.

What are you going to be doing there?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Helping our partners most of all. They need things from basic IT support, to
help them with Rita’s theatre experience in their reach-out efforts where they
perform theatre of the oppressed.

Can I help?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course! What do you want to do? Donations (see right hand side) are a easy
way to help big.

Or you can help Beira Project with its website, designing a logo, helping us
organise things. What do you think you’d like to do?

We are also looking for some very specific items, but if you have any
Portuguese language books you can give to the schools in rural Mozambique, we
know they need them. Similarly, if you have a working condition laptop that you
are willing to donate, please let us know.

Feel free to contact us with any ideas you might have or just if you want to
help us.

When did you start thinking about this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We started thinking about this years ago, but it was in September 2009 (about a
year before our trip) that we decided to go forward and started planning.
