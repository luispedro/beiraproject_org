Fundraiser **May 29 6-9pm**. `Sign up
<https://beiraproject.wufoo.com/forms/fundraiser-signup/>`_.

This will be a fundraising cocktail party held at our house, with *wine*, *summer
cocktails*, and *gourmet appetizers* (with a Mozambican flavour).

Sign up is not mandatory, but it helps us know how many to expect and you can
immediately donate online to simplify things. You can also donate at the party.

What will the money be for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The money will be used to buy materials for use by our partners in Mozambique.
Mainly computer hardware and school supplies are needed.

We will have a more detailed list before the actual event.

The money **will not** be used to pay for our trips (which we will pay out of
pocket), our lodging (we will be lodged by our partners on the ground), or our
food.

Besides money is there anything else you need?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you happen to have any Portuguese language books (for any age), this will be very helpful. Also, working computer hardware is much appreciated.

Can I donate at the party?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, of course.
