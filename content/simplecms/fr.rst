`Sign up now </fr/signup/>`_.

This will be a fundraising cocktail party held at our house, with *wine*, *summer
cocktails*, and *gourmet appetizers* (with a Mozambican flavour). It's one
great party.

Sign up is not required, but it helps us know how many to expect and you can
immediately donate online to simplify things. You can also donate at the party.

What can I do to help?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bring friends!

Seriously, this is a big help: it's win-win-win-win: we get a better party, our
Mozambican organisations get more money, they have a great time, and you get
thanked for inviting them.gq

What will the money be for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We just collect the money. The money will go, split 50/50 to `EsMaBaMa
<http://www.esmabama.org>`_ and `Kufunana <http://www.kufunana.org>`_. These
were our partners on our trip last year and we guarantee you they will spend it
well.

Can I get a tax receipt?
------------------------

Yes, esmabama can give you one. Please talk to us to get one.
